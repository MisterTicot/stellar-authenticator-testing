    <h2>Welcome to Stellar Authenticator!</h2>
    <p>
      Stellar Authenticator is a tool for creating accounts and validating
      transactions on the Stellar blockchain. On this network, each one is
      responsible for its own accounts and Stellar Authenticator helps you with
      that. All your private data are kept encrypted on your computer and only
      your requests are sent on the internet.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are a few click away from your Stellar account. All you need to do is
      to pick an username and a password. Please choose something that you will
      remember for sure. If you loose them, you won't be able to access your
      accounts anymore. There's no password recovery mechanism as nobody else
      will know about your username/password.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you only want to see how Stellar Authenticator works, you can try the
      <a onclick="authenticator.demoVersion()">demo version</a>.  Please remember that
      there's not much to do in there, as it is merely an authenticator for
      external Stellar services.
    <p>

    <h2> About </h2>

    <h3> History </h3>

    <p>I initially came to Stellar looking for a solution for organising a
    small ICO (a fundraise based on the blockchain). I wanted to offer a way
    for donators to securely & easily manage their wallet by themself. I was
    not satisfied by available solution security-wise, as exposing donators to
    the possibility of a wallet crack was not an option. I've been offered the
    means to go ahead and implement my own solution, thanks to Stellar
    Foundation kind support. </p>

    <h3> What I'm solving </h3>

    <p> I've created Stellar Authenticator and cosmic links in an effort to
    bring additional security into the Stellar ecosystem. Precisely, I aimed to
    offer a solution to the following problems : </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Most Stellar services implement their own way to create/secure seed
      wich's redundant. This energy could be spent developping their own
      specificity instead.</li>

      <li>Most Stellar wallets/exchanges don't allow users to easily sign
      transaction emitted by external sources.</li>

      <li>User experience may be tedious for non-technical beings. (Although
      better than most blockchain, I would say)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Solution </h3>

    <p>I started looking at a solution that would achieve those goals :</p>

    <ul>
      <li> Stellar services would be offered a way to rely on already
      implemented tools to login/sign transaction. Coders could spend more
      energy on implementing something new. </li>

      <li> Stellar wallets would be offered a way to serve as login/signing
      tools for thoses services. </li>

      <li> New users would be offered a platform that allow them to secure
      their founds without headaches. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Design </h3>

    <p> After talking with other community members, the solution came up of
    expressing Stellar transaction requests as URL queries. That would be the
    common language between all services/wallets. The
    <a href="https://cosmic.link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cosmic.link</a>
    website would serve as a secure relay when direct connection between the
    service and the wallet would not be possible. In this scheme, Stellar
    Authenticator offer a way to create accounts and securely store the private
    keys. It allows to sign transactions so that you don't need to give away
    thoses keys. By narrowing its purpose solely on this task, I can keep the
    codebase size under control. Then, this is easier to audit it and to keep
    it secure and well-functioning. </p>

    <h3> Future </h3>

    <p> Nowaday, this design is fully implemented and functional. This is still
    in the beta phase, though. This means that it's stable enough to be used
    and the core features have been tested enough. However, some additional
    features are still to be implemented before I can say to job is done.
    Namely cloud syncing, hardware wallets support, encrypted paper wallet, a
    better support for multi-signatures accounts and transaslation in other
    languages. </p>

    <h3> Licence </h3>

    a free software licence that allows you to read, copy, edit and distribute
    the code with or without your changes. The development costs are supported
    by the Stellar Foundation and the donators.</p>

    <h2>Please enable Javascript :)</h2>

    <p>Stellar Authenticator is heavily based on Javascript. This is
    because all the code run locally on your machine; We don't store any
    data nor interfer by any means in your usage of this application besides
    serving the code to you. There's several reason you may come to this
    page without a proper Javascript support. If it's because your device
    doesn't handle it, there's not much we can do about it.</p>

    <p>Maybe you disabled Javascript because malware/security/anonymity
    concerns. You should know that Stellar Authenticator is a free software
    and the code we serve is fully available to be reviewed. If you have
    the required skill you can easily check that we don't run any external
    script here.</p>

    <p>If you wish, it is possible to download this web application and to
    run it from your computer, or even offline.</p>
